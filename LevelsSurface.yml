      This is an excavator.  


      It digs up the ground behind it.  


      You will need to drag it to the collection site.

      From now on, you'll need to fully excavate each site.  


      Thankfully we hired a lot of teams for the job.


      Make sure each excavator finds its way to the correct site.

      Careful, the excavators cannot cross each other's paths!


      You can undo or reset if you get stuck.
