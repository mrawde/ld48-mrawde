      This is an excavator.  


      It digs up the ground behind it.  


      You will need to drag it to the collection site.

      We hired too many teams for the job.  


      Now you have to make sure each excavator finds its way to the correct
      site.

      The excavators cannot cross each other's paths.


      You can undo or reset if you get stuck.
